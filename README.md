In this project, I developed the headers, specifically multiple headers. I styled and redesigned the
homepage header and the library header depending on where the user is located. I also implemented a
notification for unsuccessful searches. In addition to this, I served as the Scrum Master in the
team, handling organizational matters and trying to create a favorable environment. Since I've been
working with the team for a long time, everything was smooth and coordinated. I am grateful to
everyone for being so awesome!
